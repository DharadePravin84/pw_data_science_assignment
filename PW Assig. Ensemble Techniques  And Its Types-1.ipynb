    "Ans:\n",

    " Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to improve predictive performance, increase robustness, and reduce overfitting. By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble techniques can often achieve better results than any single model alone."

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    " Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique in ensemble learning where multiple models are trained on different random subsets of the training data with replacement. The final prediction is typically made by averaging the predictions of all the models (for regression) or by taking a majority vote (for classification)."

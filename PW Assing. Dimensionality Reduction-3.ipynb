    "#### Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are key concepts in linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues are scalars that represent how a matrix transformation stretches or shrinks its corresponding eigenvector. Eigenvectors are vectors that only change in scale, not in direction, under a given transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen-decomposition is a method used to break down a matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which simplifies various calculations and analyses. For example, a 2x2 matrix A can be decomposed into a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the form: A = PDP^-1 where P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. This simplifies operations involving the matrix A.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Eigen decomposition is a process in linear algebra where a square matrix is decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Its significance lies in various applications such as finding principal components, solving differential equations, and understanding the behavior of linear transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A square matrix is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the dimension of the matrix. This condition ensures that the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, allowing the matrix to be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The spectral theorem states that for a symmetric matrix, all eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. This theorem is significant in Eigen-Decomposition because it guarantees the existence of a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors for symmetric matrices, making them diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Eigenvalues of a matrix A can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A−λI)=0, where λ represents the eigenvalues. Eigenvalues represent how the matrix scales its corresponding eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that remain in the same direction but may be scaled when a linear transformation is applied represented by a matrix. They are related to eigenvalues as the eigenvectors represent the directions along which the linear transformation (matrix) operates, and the eigenvalues represent the scaling factor by which the eigenvectors are scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Geometrically, eigenvectors represent the directions along which a linear transformation stretches or compresses space, and eigenvalues represent the factor by which space is stretched or compressed along those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Real-world applications include image compression, signal processing, solving differential equations, structural analysis, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "#### Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "A matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues if it is defective. A defective matrix is a square matrix that does not have a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors. In this case, there may be fewer eigenvectors than the dimension of the matrix, resulting in repeated eigenvalues and multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with each repeated eigenvalue.\n",
    "However, it's important to note that non-defective matrices, particularly symmetric matrices, typically have a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors, each associated with a distinct eigenvalue. This ensures that the eigen decomposition of such matrices is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10. In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning? Discuss at least three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition is used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization, and solving systems of linear differential equations in dynamic modeling."

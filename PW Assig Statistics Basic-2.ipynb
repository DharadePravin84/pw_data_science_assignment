    "- Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",

Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables, providing a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",

For example, in a dataset of salaries, an extremely high salary may inflate the mean, while an extremely low salary may increase the range and standard deviation.\n",

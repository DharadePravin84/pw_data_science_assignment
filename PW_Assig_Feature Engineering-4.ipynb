    "#### Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "- Ans: \n",
    "Data Encoding in Data Science: \n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is a crucial step in data science, involving the conversion of categorical or text data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning. Common techniques include label encoding, one-hot encoding, binary encoding, ordinal encoding, and frequency encoding. This process is essential for algorithm compatibility, improving model performance, handling categorical variables, and effective feature engineering. By transforming raw data into a numeric format, encoding enables machine learning models to work with diverse data types, ultimately enhancing their predictive capabilities."

    "#### Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "- Ans: Nominal encoding is a method for representing categorical data without inherent order. One common approach is one-hot encoding, where each category is converted into a binary vector. For example, in encoding colors (Red, Blue, Green), each color is represented by a unique binary code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red: [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "- Blue: [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "- Green: [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "- Nominal encoding is useful in scenarios like natural language processing and image classification, where categories lack a meaningful order. This technique ensures accurate representation without introducing unintended relationships between categories."

    "- Nominal encoding, specifically one-hot encoding, is preferred when dealing with categorical data without inherent order. It is advantageous in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical features lack a meaningful hierarchy (e.g., colors or movie genres).\n",
    "- Avoiding implied relationships is crucial to prevent misinterpretation by machine learning models.\n",
    "- Example: Movie Genres\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a movie dataset, genres like \"Action,\" \"Comedy,\" and \"Drama\" are non-ordinal. One-hot encoding represents each genre with a binary vector:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Movie 2: [0, 1, 0] (Comedy)\n",

    "For a dataset with 5 unique categorical values without any inherent order, one-hot encoding is a suitable technique. This method represents each category with a binary vector, maintaining the nominal nature of the data.

    "- Ans: \n",
    "- For a dataset containing categorical information about different types of animals, including their species, habitat, and diet, a suitable encoding technique would be a combination of label encoding and one-hot encoding. Let's break down the justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Label Encoding for Ordinal Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the \"species\" column has an inherent order or hierarchy (ordinal data), label encoding would be appropriate. It assigns unique numerical labels to different species based on their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding for Nominal Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For categorical columns like \"habitat\" and \"diet,\" where there is no inherent order among the categories (nominal data), one-hot encoding is suitable. It represents each category as a binary vector, ensuring no implied relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Label encoding is chosen for \"species\" if there is an order among the species (e.g., herbivore, carnivore, omnivore).\n",

    "- Diet: [1, 0, 0] (Carnivore), [0, 1, 0] (Herbivore), [0, 1, 0] (Herbivore)\n",

    "### Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "In simple linear regression, we have a single independent variable(predictor) that is used to predict the dependent variable(response). The relationship between the two variables is assumed to be linear, and the goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n",
    "- Example of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict a student's fine exam score(dependent variable) based on the number of hours they spent studying(independent variable). Here, the number of hours studied is the only preditor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "In multiple linear regression,there are multiple independet variables used a single dependent variable. The relationship is still assumed to be linear, and the goal is to find the best-fitting hyperplane in the multidimensional space that inimizes the sum of squared differences.\n",
    "- Example of Multiple Linear Regression:\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Slope and Intercept in Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slope (β1):\n",
    "- The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "- If β1 is positive, it indicates a positive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If negative, it suggests a negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intercept (βo):\n",
    "- The intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "- In many cases, the intercept may not have a meaningful interpretation, especially if zero values for all independent variables are not possible or meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Predicting House Prices\n",
    "- If β1 (slope) is 150, it means, on average, each additional square foot is associated with a $150 increase in predicted house price.\n",
    "- If βo (intercept) is $50,000, it represents the predicted price when square footage is zero (not practically meaningful in this context)."

    "Ans:\n",
    "### Gradient Descent in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is a crucial optimization algorithm in machine learning used to minimize the cost function of a model. The process involves iteratively adjusting model parameters based on the calculated gradient, which represents the steepest direction of change in the cost function. By updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, the algorithm aims to find the minimum of the cost function, effectively improving the model's performance. It is widely applied in training linear regression, neural networks, and various supervised learning algorithms. The choice of a suitable learning rate and the type of gradient descent (batch, stochastic, or mini-batch) influences the convergence speed and effectiveness of the optimization process."

    "Ans: \n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, involving the prediction of a dependent variable based on two or more independent variables. The model is represented as Y = βo + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + … + βn Xn +ϵ . In contrast to simple linear regression, which deals with a single predictor, multiple linear regression enables the consideration of multiple factors simultaneously. This model is more versatile, allowing for the exploration of complex relationships and interactions between variables. The analysis involves estimating coefficients (β) that represent the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable. Multiple linear regression is widely used in various fields for predictive modeling and understanding the relationships between multiple variables."

        "Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects features based on their statistical relationship with the target variable. This method works independently of any machine learning algorithms and evaluates each feature individually. Common techniques used in the Filter method include:\n",
        "- Correlation Coefficient: Measures the correlation between each feature and the target variable.\n",
        "- Chi-Square Test: Evaluates the association between categorical features and the target variable.\n",
        "- Mutual Information: Measures the amount of information shared between each feature and the target variable.\n",
        "- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Tests the differences between means of different groups for categorical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets based on their performance on a specific machine learning algorithm. The key differences include:\n",
        "- Model Dependency: The Wrapper method is model-specific, meaning it evaluates features in the context of the machine learning algorithm used.\n",
        "- Feature Interaction: The Wrapper method considers interactions between features, whereas the Filter method evaluates each feature individually.\n",
        "- Computational Cost: The Wrapper method is computationally expensive as it involves training and evaluating a model multiple times with different feature subsets.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedded feature selection methods integrate the feature selection process within the model training process. Common techniques include:\n",
        "- Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero, thus selecting features.\n",
        "- Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, though it doesn't necessarily eliminate features but can reduce their impact.\n",
        "- Elastic Net Regularization: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization penalties to balance feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
        "- Decision Trees and Random Forests: These models inherently perform feature selection by evaluating the importance of features during the tree-building process.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawbacks of the Filter method include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ignores Feature Interactions: Evaluates each feature independently, missing potential interactions between features.\n",
        "- Model-Agnostic: Doesn't consider the specific machine learning algorithm, which might lead to suboptimal feature subsets for certain models.\n",
        "- Simplicity: May oversimplify the selection process, potentially overlooking complex relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Filter method is preferred when:\n",
        "\n",
        "- High Dimensionality: When dealing with datasets with a large number of features, the Filter method is computationally efficient.\n",
        "- Exploratory Analysis: In the initial stages of analysis to quickly identify relevant features before applying more complex methods.\n",
        "- Resource Constraints: When computational resources are limited, the Filter method's efficiency can be advantageous.\n",
        "- Independence of Model: When you want to select features without committing to a specific machine learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. In a telecom company, you are working on a project to develop a predictive model for customer churn.

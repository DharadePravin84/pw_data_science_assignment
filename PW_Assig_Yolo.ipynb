        "Q1. What is the fundamental idea behind the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework?\n",
        "\n",
        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a single-stage object detection framework that processes an image in a single pass, predicting both the bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects directly from full images. This approach enables real-time object detection by dividing the image into a grid and making predictions for each cell.\n",

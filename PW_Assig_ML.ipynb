        "\n",
        "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- Siri or Alexa: Virtual assistants that can understand and respond to voice commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. The machine improves its performance as it is exposed to more data over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- Spam Email Filtering: An algorithm that learns to classify emails as spam or not spam based on features of the emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence \"deep\") to model complex patterns in data. These models are particularly good at handling large amounts of unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- Image Recognition: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used to recognize objects in images, such as identifying faces in a photo.\n",

        "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output.\n",

        "Examples:\n",
        "- Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.\n",

        "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data without labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any explicit instruction on what to learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.\n",

        "- Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data and aims to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures; examples include clustering and association.\n",
        "- Semi-Supervised Learning: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. Typically, a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. It aims to improve learning accuracy by leveraging the unlabeled data.\n",

        "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by identifying patterns and structures in data and then finding data points that do not fit these patterns. Techniques like clustering (e.g., k-means) or density estimation (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) can be used to model the normal behavior of the data. Data points that fall far from these normal clusters or have low probability under the estimated density can be flagged as anomalies.\n",

        "\n",
        "MongoDB:\n",
        "- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of storing data in tables as in a relational database, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the data flexible, scalable, and easy to query.\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-relational databases:\n",
        "- Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to store, retrieve, and manage large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. They do not use the traditional table-based relational model but instead utilize various data models such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenarios to use MongoDB over SQL databases:\n",
        "- When you need to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
        "- When you require high performance and scalability.\n",
        "- When your data schema is likely to change frequently.\n",
        "- When you need to integrate with modern web, mobile, and IoT applications.\n",
        "- When you need to store complex hierarchical data structures (e.g., nested data).\n",

        "Features of MongoDB:\n",
        "1. Document-oriented: Data is stored in JSON-like BSON documents which are flexible and can vary in structure.\n",
        "2. Schema-less: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema, allowing for more flexible and agile development.\n",
        "3. High performance: Supports indexing, sharding, and replication, ensuring high availability and performance.\n",
        "4. Horizontal scalability: Easily scales horizontally by adding more servers to the database.\n",
        "5. Rich query language: Provides a rich query language with support for ad-hoc queries, indexing, aggregation, and more.\n",
        "6. Replication: Provides high availability with replica sets, allowing automatic failover and data redundancy.\n",
        "7. Sharding: Supports horizontal partitioning of data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and high-throughput operations.\n",
        "8. Aggregation framework: Offers powerful tools to perform data aggregation operations similar to SQLâ€™s GROUP BY clause."
